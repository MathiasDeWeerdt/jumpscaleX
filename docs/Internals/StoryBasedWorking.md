## principles

- only work when story exists or critical bug where in scrum was defined we need to work on it
- story = issue with lavel type_story

### reporting

- when story is critical or major, EVERY 1/2 day the contributors put comment on the issue, so everyone can follow
- when story non critical and working on it, at least once every day some comment on the stories you are working
- when ETA is known put this in your comment (e.g. 2 days from now, ...)

### branching

- when not mentioned develop on branch development
- if you believe your code is potentially dangerous and branch not specified check with scrum lead if there should be no branch
- branchname development_$revelantname
- sometimes multiple story cards can have same branchname
- use pull request, leave open untill all stories linked to this branch are done (can merge in into development whenever useful & reviewed)
