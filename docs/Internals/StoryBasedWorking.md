## principles

- only work items attached to story (in other words story needs to exist) or critical bug where in scrum was defined we need to work on it
- story = issue with level type_story
- the stories need to be visible in sort of kanban overview per iteration called sprint
- no-one should work on stories not being in sprint & approved by stakeholders, unless if blocking issue which is then approved by scrum team/lead
- on home repo should be clear who the scrum teams are and they should be linked to their kanban overviews of the stroies being worked on

### reporting

- when story is critical or major, EVERY 1/2 day the contributors put comment on the issue, so everyone can follow
- when story non critical and working on it, at least once every day some comment on the stories you are working
- when ETA is known put this in your comment (e.g. 2 days from now, ...)

### branching

- when not mentioned develop on branch development
- if you believe your code is potentially dangerous and branch not specified check with scrum lead if there should be no branch
- branchname development_$revelantname
- sometimes multiple story cards can have same branchname
- use pull request, leave open untill all stories linked to this branch are done (can merge in into development whenever useful & reviewed)
- put the branchname without development_ in the title of the issue in [] e.g. development_builder would be [builder] at end of title of issue
