    """
    class which groups functionality to print to a console
    self.width=120
    self.indent=0 #current indentation of messages send to console
    self.reformat=False #if True will make sure message fits nicely on screen
    """
    #!!CONSOLE!!

    def xxx(self):
        pass
```

will result in  (for part CONSSOLE)

```python
class Console(j.application.JSBaseClass):
    """
    class which groups functionality to print to a console
    self.width=120
    self.indent=0 #current indentation of messages send to console
    self.reformat=False #if True will make sure message fits nicely on screen
    """
```

## Example 6 (python code with doc_only)

```include('$NAME',part="CONSOLE", doc_only=True)```


```python

class OTHER():
    pass

class Console(j.application.JSBaseClass):  #!!CONSOLE!!
    """
    class which groups functionality to print to a console
    self.width=120
    self.indent=0 #current indentation of messages send to console
    self.reformat=False #if True will make sure message fits nicely on screen
    """

        """
        something
        """


    #!!CONSOLE!!

    def xxx(self):
        pass
```

will result in  (for part CONSSOLE)

```
class which groups functionality to print to a console
self.width=120
self.indent=0 #current indentation of messages send to console
