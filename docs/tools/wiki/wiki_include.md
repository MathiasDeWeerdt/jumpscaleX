# Include macro

there is a lot of smartness around includes (is +- same as links), authors can use following

## how will doc generator find info

!!!include("wiki/links.md!LINK")

the name or path of part needs to be unique

if repo or docsite not mentioned then will look in current repo

## generic format

- how to use markers see [code_wiki_parts.md]

```
\!!!include("$LINK")
```

- $LINK is the link info see previous section

## with markers

- how to use markers see [code_wiki_parts.md]

```
\!!!include("wiki/links.md!LINK")
```

basically ! marks the PART name, in this case it will link to that section


## some python code

```
\!!!include("console/Console.py!CONSOLE",doc_only=True)
```
